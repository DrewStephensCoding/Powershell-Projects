# Powershell-Projects
Various Powershell scripts I've created to help automate my work

## Menu_V1
This is a quick reference menu I built for work, instead of having my computer desktop being cluttered with folder shortcuts and links. </br>

## User Friendly Menu
Similar to Menu_V1, but more user friendly.  Instead of your file paths being hard coded in the ps1 file, you add your button names and links inside the Buttons.txt file.  Menu-V2.ps1 loops through and auto generates the specified button information.  This version strips the image box from the user form and also doesn't include the printer status check like the [Menu_V1](Powershell-Projects/Menu-V1/Main_Menu.ps1) does <br />
